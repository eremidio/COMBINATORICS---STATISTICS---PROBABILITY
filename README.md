# COMBINATORICS --- STATISTICS  --- PROBABILITY

THE PRESENT REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN MANY MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS RELATED TO THE AREAS OF COMBINATORICS, THE THEORY OF PROBABILITY, STATISTICS, INTEGER SEQUENCES, GRAPH THEORY, GAME THEORY, AND SOME RELATED AREAS GROUPED UNDER THE NAME OF DISCRETE MATHEMATICS.

THESE AREAS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND FOUNDATIONAL IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS IN GENERAL. THE PRESENT REPOSITORY IS NOT INTENDEND TO BE A COMPLETE COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEM PER SI, BUT ONLY PROVIDE SOME USEFUL SNIPPETS OF CODE THE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS THAT CAN BE USEFUL IN NUMERICAL STUDIES OR WHEN ONE IS IMPLEMENTING MORE SOFISTICATED ALGORITHMS IN THESE OR IN OTHER RELATED AREAS LIKE NUMBER THEORY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY.

# OBSERVATIONS: 
SOMETIMES WE SHALL MAKE USE OF THIRD LIBRARIES LIKE BOOST IN C++ FOR SOME UTILITIES LIKE MULTIPRECISION ARITHMETIC. THERE ARE PLENTY OF RESOURCES ONLINE ON HOW TO INSTALL THESE LIBRARIES.

THIS REPOSITORY WILL COVER ONLY SOME BASIC ASPECTS (I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL MATHEMATICIAN) AND THE READER INTERESTED CAN CONSULT THE FOLLOWING BIBLIOGRAPHY:
